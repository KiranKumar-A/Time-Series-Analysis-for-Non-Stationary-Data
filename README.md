# Time-Series-Analysis-for-Non-Stationary-Data

Master's course by Assistant Professor Motegi in third quartre, 2017, Kobe University.  
The course covers theories of univariate and multivariate nonstationary time series analysis. (random walk, unit root, trend stationarity, spurious regression, cointegration, vector error correction model, etc.)
  
The syllabus is available [here](https://kym-syllabus.ofc.kobe-u.ac.jp/kobe_syllabus/2017/44/data/2017_3E612.html)  
  
The contents shared are Monte Carlo simulations under various conditions and some empirical applications using Python (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)
